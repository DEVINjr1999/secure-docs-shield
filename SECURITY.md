- Client-side generation marked as deprecated

### 4. XSS Vulnerability Fixes

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Implementation**:
- Removed `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage
- Created secure `PrintStyles` component for CSS injection
- Added DOMPurify for input sanitization
- Implemented comprehensive input validation

### 5. Session Security Enhancements

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Implementation**:
- Session invalidation on security-sensitive profile changes
- Automatic logout on role/status changes
